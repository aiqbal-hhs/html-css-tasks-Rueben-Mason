<p>It was gorgeous. It was everything I’d ever imagined and ……now it was mine. The pink diamond was mine after all this time. </p>

In Auckland city secretly hiding in a bay within Waitemata harbour,  I own a 2.2 million dollar submarine. I hired my friend to operate it because he is a professional. His name is Pavel and he comes from the motherland (Soviet Russia).  Pavel and I started working together to infiltrate the Ruthless drug Lord, El Rubio’s private island, Cayo Perico, in Bora Bora, Tahiti.

Pavel started to gather equipment for our mission while I set off to Cayo Perico to gather intel. The trip there was very long. When I finally got there, I had a minor case of jetlag. There was a guard there to greet me when I got off the plane. I fooled him by wearing a guards uniform to get past him. I hot-wired the nearest car and traveled over to the compound to gather intel on what was being kept safe. By the compound was the communications tower. I snuck past the guards and using pavel’s equipment I hacked into the camera’s to see what big purchase Mr Rubio had made. Then one by one I checked all of the rooms and finally I saw what Mr Rubio was hiding in the basement of his compound.  It was a pink diamond worth about 3 million dollars. ,

The stage was set.  Pavel and I gathered all of the necessary equipment like the sonar jammer so the enemy wouldn't see our submarine from enemy radar. 
We also gathered the plasma cutter to cut through the thick glass that was containing the pink diamond and the cutting torch to cut our way into the sewage pipe to enter the compound without being detected. <br></p>

The day finally came where we would rob Mr Rubio. We dove 200 meters underwater in the submarine and made our way over to Cayo Perico. When we got there we swam over to the underwater sewage pipe wearing our rebreathers. We cut our way into the compound.  We made our way up the sewage pipe, and silently and systematically took out the guards and made our way over to the basement. We stole keycards to get in and we started to cut our way through the thick glass holding the pink diamond. It took 5 minutes of cutting with the plasma cutter and when it was done we had made a hole in the glass big enough to reach inside and snatch the pink diamond.   It was gorgeous. It was everything I’d ever imagined and ……now it was mine. Then we made our way past the security and back into the water. We swam back over to the submarine and back to Auckland. <br></p>

We sold the pink diamond to a secret buyer and bought a mansion with our money. It had fifteen rooms and seven bathrooms and a huge swimming pool, a sauna, and a spa.  We hired a chef, and bought 7 classic cars and motorbikes. <br></p>
